## What I Learned

**Technical**
- ADC input range planning is critical for bipolar signals
- Cleanroom contamination cascades through entire process
- SPI debugging requires logic analyzer, not just oscilloscope

**Process**
- Should have validated each module independently
- Earlier integration testing would have caught board issue
- Hardware-software co-design needs tighter iteration loops
